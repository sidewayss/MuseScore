This is the "newlayout" branch.

The purpose of this branch is to implement a more sphisticated layout by replacing
"Space" by something which describes the bounding box of an Segment in a threedimensional
way. This allows to calculate the minimal horizontal and vertical space needed without
any collisions.


First Milestone:
Construct the bounding box for every Staff/Segment. Paint the bounding box in
debug mode.
